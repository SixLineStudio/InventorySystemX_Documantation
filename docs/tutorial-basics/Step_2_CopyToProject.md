# Copy plugin to project folder

## Console Command

All Engine plugins are located in the **Engine** folder. To move all files to the **Plugin** folder in your project
directory,
open the console and enter:

```js
isx.CopyInventoryToProjectFolder
```

The editor may freeze for a few seconds, which is normal.

After that, close your project and **reopen it**.

After reopening the editor, you should enable the display of the plugin folder and check if there is a folder named "
Inventory System X" in it.

If it's there, everything went well and can go to the [Next Page](Step_3_addMain–°omponents).

## To copy the plugin files manually

Unreal Engine stores all plugins purchased from the Marketplace in the following location:

- ``C:\Program Files\Epic Games\UE_[version]\Engine\Plugins\Marketplace`` on Windows

- ``/Users/Shared/Epic Games/UE_[version]/Engine/Plugins/Marketplace`` on macOS

To copy the plugin to your project folder, follow these steps:

1. Go to the location mentioned above and copy the folder named "Inventory System X".
2. Navigate to the root directory of your project, and if there is a folder named "Plugins" in it, paste the plugin
   there.
   If there is no such folder, create it first.

You can now proceed to the next step.
